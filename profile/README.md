Open Choreo is a self-hosted internal developer platform (IDP) designed to simplify software delivery for platform engineers and developers:

- **Platform Engineers:** Integrates CI/CD, security, and cloud tooling, reducing operational overhead while enforcing best practices.
- **Developers:** Abstracts infrastructure complexities, enabling faster development and deployment.

Open Choreo combines the benefits of custom-built and SaaS-based IDPsâ€”offering customization and control without sacrificing ease of adoption.
