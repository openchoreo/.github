- **Platform Engineers:** Integrates CI/CD, security, and cloud tooling, reducing operational overhead while enforcing best practices.
- **Developers:** Abstracts infrastructure complexities, enabling faster development and deployment.

Open Choreo combines the benefits of custom-built and SaaS-based IDPs—offering customization and control without sacrificing ease of adoption.
